# User-Segmentation
**KEY INSIGHTS**

**AIM:** The aim of this project is to learn how to create detailed profiles that represent the behaviours and preferences of users and also divide this users into groups for the purpose of tailoring Ads properly.

# ABOUT THE DATASET
The dataset comprises a diverse set of user metrics collected from an online platform, consisting of 1,000 user profiles with 16 distinct features. These features include demographics (age, gender, income level, and education), online behavior (likes and reactions, followed accounts, device usage), engagement with content (time spent online during weekdays and weekends, click-through rates, conversion rates), interaction with ads (ad interaction time), and user interests.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Develop a robust user profiling and segmentation system that leverages machine learning and data analysis techniques to categorize users into distinct segments. By analyzing user interaction data, demographic information, and engagement metrics, identify meaningful patterns and clusters within the user base. The ultimate goal is to enable businesses to tailor their advertising campaigns to the identified segments, thereby increasing ad relevance, user engagement, and conversion rates while optimizing ad spend.

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
The dataset has been cleaned and does not contain missing values thus it is ready for exploration.

Analysing the distribution of Age, Gender, Education Level, Income Level we can conclude that:
25-34 is the most common age group, with 65+ be the least frequent
Male and Female gender are equally distributed
Education Level is fairly evenly distributed
Income Level is also fairly evenly distributed with 0-20k being the least frequent income level
